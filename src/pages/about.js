            Swiss-British artist based between Geneva and London working across sculpture, installation and text. 
            Founding member of LIMBO, an off-space in Geneva that aims to question Geneva's nature as an intermediary space, a place where the world reconvenes to discuss global issues without the decisions impacting the soil whereby they are made. The bubble. At LIMBO we are interested in what cultures emerge under the blankets of intermediary space created by global culture. 
            A member of COLLECTIVE DISGRACE, group of four young artists based in Geneva interested in the concepts of alteration, the monstrous and the strange. Together, we work and play with questions regarding apocalyptic imaginaries by reappropriating fear as a tool for collective action. We believe fear can be a positive force with the power to relativize our existence in the face of otherness, which we have constructed as a form of “Nature”,  putting humans in contact with their environment.
